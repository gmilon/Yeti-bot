# Yeti-bot

> Nuxt.js project

Frontend part of Yeti-bot

**SVGs** are awesome ! **VueJs** and **Nuxt.js** are awesome ! I'm just trying to play with both

## The project

Chat-bots are commonly plugged with a simple chat scroll-view like this :

But I think we can make this a little bit more funny using SVGs :

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

```
